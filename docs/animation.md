# Customize Animation

## Change the speed of the piece movement, `piece.move.time`
By default, piece movement takes 200 milliseconds. This can be changed by the value of `piece.move.time` in the file `ChessBuddy.properties`. For example, the following line sets the piece movement to take 0.5 second:
```
piece.move.time = 500
```

## More settings to be implemented...
